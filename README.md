🧬 AI for Oncology: Transforming Cancer Care with Advanced Diagnosis and Treatment Models

📌 Overview
This project proposes an AI-powered oncology system that leverages deep learning and multi-modal data integration (medical imaging, genomics, clinical records) to improve:
Early cancer detection
Accurate diagnosis & staging
Personalized treatment planning
Global cancer trend monitoring
The system integrates CNNs for image-based diagnosis, transformer models for genomic analysis, and Explainable AI (XAI) methods like SHAP and LIME for transparency. A web-based application (Flask/Django) provides oncologists, researchers, and patients with real-time analysis, dashboards, and treatment advisory tools.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Backend: Python (Flask / Django)
Machine Learning / AI:
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) – Medical imaging
Transformers – Genomic data
LSTM/RNN – Time-series & recurrence prediction
Explainable AI: SHAP, LIME
Data Sources: Imaging datasets (MRI, CT, X-ray), genomic data, clinical records
Visualization: Plotly, Matplotlib, Dashboards

🚀 Features
🧪 Early Cancer Diagnosis using CNNs for MRI/CT scans
🔬 Cancer Type & Stage Prediction via multi-modal AI
💊 Personalized Treatment Advisory using genomics & patient data
🌍 Global Cancer Trends Dashboard for incidence & survival tracking
⚖️ Explainable AI (XAI) for model transparency and trust
📊 Interactive Web Dashboard for oncologists and researchers
